    "## Activation Functions\n",
    "An __activation function__ is, in simple terms, a \"weighted sum\" of its inputs that has an added bias. The output determines whether or not our neuron/node should be \"fired.\" Since our nodes don't have inherent bounds or understandings of when it should fire, we need to give it one ourselves. **We basically say \"your potential output is high enough that we should consider this significant.\"** \n",
    "\n",
    "We use activation functions to calculate values through the layers of the neural network and determine a confidence score for each neuron. \n",
    "As you go through these, you don't necessarily have to be understand the use case of each one right away. For now, try to simply gain a familiarity of what each function does so that later you can more easily apply the correct one. \n",
    "\n",
    "The most common ones are listed here:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Linear\n",
    "This activation function has the formula $$f(x)=x$$\n",
    "<img src=\"act_linear.png\" width=\"300\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, this means that the input value will be directly proportional to the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is usually not the best function to use, because the values are unbounded and can essentially be any value. This good thing about linear activation functions is that it is precise. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sigmoid\n",
    "\n",
    "This activation function has the formula $$f(x) = \\frac{1}{(1+e^{-x})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"act_sigmoid.png\" width=\"300\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is non-linear and looks like a \"smoothed-out step function.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What's cool about Sigmoid functions is that they are bounded between 0 and 1. This allows use to use decimal numbers for precision, but keeps the values in a range that is predictable. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### ReLu\n",
    "The ReLu activation function has the formula  $$f(x) = max(0,x)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"act_relu.png\" width=\"300\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "This is similar to the linear activation function, but values less than 0 are simply 0. This means that the values are unbounded in the positive direction, but bounded in the negative direction. The con is that it is not as precise as the sigmoid function. However, it is a lot simpler and computationally far easier for a computer to calculate! And even though it is so simple, in many case it is sufficient. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Which activation function do I use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, there isn't always a simple answer for this. Sometimes, you should use more than one, sometimes, as single one works just as well. When beginning and writing simple neural networks, you can simply test multiple and see which one (or which combination) works best. However, once you create more and more complex networks, it makes much more sense to pick your activation functions based on what type of data you're using and how you want that data processed. Since these are often somewhat complicated, we won't go over them here, but if you'd like further explanation of these activation functions, here's a good place to start:\n",

    "## When and Why Should I Use a Neural Network?\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are incredibly good at finding patterns and trends in highly multivariate data. If you have a classification problem where you want a binary output from simple data, you might not want to use a neural network. For example, if you just want to know if something is mostly red or mostly blue and you're given the RGB values of pixels, a neural network would probably be up for the task, but it would likely be much more efficient to just write a program to find the average values of the pixels in question, sort them into \"blue\" and \"red,\" and give you an answer \"blue\" or \"red\" based on the amounts of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, what if you want a computer to recognize from a given photo whether or not a dog or a cat is pictured. This is a very common example in machine learning (and you can likely find many neural networks online solving this exact problem if you are curious to see one try this.) If you were to give a set of instructions for determining whether something was a cat or a dog to someone who had never seen or heard of either, what would you put in those instructions? You can say \"cats are generally smaller than dogs,\" but what if the person is shown a picture of a corgi or a chihuahua? Would you tell them to look at the ears? Although cats' ears are generally pretty similar, there are definitely breeds of dogs with ears similar to cats.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer isn't simple, and is a great example of what a neural network is for. Our brains are able to make this distinction easily, likely because there are hundreds or thousands of tiny things we look for to make the distinction as soon as we see one that we are completely unaware of. It probably isn't just one or two things, its likely a combination of many characteristics, as well as previous \"data\" that we've processed, having seen cats and dogs before. Our brains aren't perfect at it either- although big cats, for example cheetas or panthers, have an extremely large number of the same characteristics as smaller cats, most people don't make the connection that they could be in the same category (even if not the same subcategory) until we're told. The different size, color, and facial shape leads us to believe that they'd be in a different animal category altogether, although when it's pointed out to us that they belong in the same grouping, our brains are suddenly able to see the connections that we otherwise might not have noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of the complexity of a classification problem like this, using a neural network to come up with a result makes a lot of sense. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why not use another classifier? In some cases, it *does* make sense to use another classifier rather than a neural network. However, due to the complexity of certain data-sets, a classifier might have a tough time getting the job done. If the data isn't in an easy-to-map shape like a linear function would be, any simple classifier might struggle to find a pattern to classify the data-set by. Although it is a good rule of thumb that a neural network is good for data that has a complex pattern, this isn't the case for all \"complex shapes,\" as some classifiers are designed specifically for this type of mapping. A neural network is only one of the tools at your disposal for this type of problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major reason to use a neural network is for the flexibility in working with datasets. For example, what if you want your algorithm to learn from pervious data and assume that the data is dependent on other datapoints in the set? For example, if you want to predict the next word given the beginning half of a sentence, the algorithm not only needs data of complete sentences, but needs to act depending on previous data. Another classification model would struggle with this kind of interdependency. \n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, there are advantages and disadvantages to using neural networks depending on the situation, and there isn't a definitive rule for when you should and shouldn't use one."

    "There are many different types of neural networks that vary in types of layers used, proportions of neurons in each layer, and how each neuron is programmed to function. For this workshop, you will only see a basic neural network, but several different types of common NNs are described here, as well as when you would want to use each one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n",
    "![CNN](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336805909/figure/fig1/AS:817888827023360@1572011300751/Schematic-diagram-of-a-basic-convolutional-neural-network-CNN-architecture-26.ppm)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you've heard of any type of NN, this is probably the one you heard about. \n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Characteristics:__ They have convolution cells, often known as \"pooling layers,\" which are layers in the neural network that simplify the processed input data by reducing unnecessary features. They also contain convolution kernels, which are matrices that are useed on a given data-set to find features from whatever matrix of data is currently being looked at.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Uses:__ Most frequently used for image recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)\n",
    "![RNN](https://i1.wp.com/dataaspirant.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/3-Recurrent-Neural-Network.png?resize=626%2C463&ssl=1)\n",
    "These NNs are used when you want to best learn from sequential information. The NNs we've looked at previously assume that inputs are independent of each other. When understanding dogs vs. cats, it doesn't matter whether your neural network was just shown a picture of a dog or a cat -- a picture of one doesn't affect a picture of the other. But if you want to, for example, predict the next word given half a sentence, you need to have some previous data -- the words that came before the word you're currently trying to guess.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Characteristics:__ These NNs use a different type of cell than the ones we've previously talked about known as a \"recurrent cell\" (like the name implies). This type of cell recieves its own output with a delay of one or more iterations. Simply, previous outputs are used as inputs so the neural network has a \"memory\" and is able to learn from previous data to process further data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Uses:__ Natural Language Processing and Speech Recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM)\n",
    "![LSTM](https://austingwalters.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/mlp.png)\n",
    "These are a type of RNN that's built to \"have a memory\" the same way an RNN is, but it's built to remember things more long-term than an RNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Characteristics:__ It uses a *memory cell* that is able to process data with large time gaps, so it can \"remember\" things that happened a long time prior to the current data being processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Uses:__ Natural Language Processing and Recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)\n",
    "![GAN](https://wiki.pathmind.com/images/wiki/gan_schema.png)\n",
    "This is likely another term that you've frequently heard if you've done some reading on machine learning. These attempt to create datasets and test the datasets on itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Characteristics:__ This type of network consists of two networks referred to as a __generator__ and a __discriminator__. The generator, as the name implies, generates datasets for given parameters. The discriminator tries to differentiate between this generated data and true sample data. The idea is that as the generator gets better at creating datasets, the generator gets better at detecting them, so they work together to hopefully create a very realistic dataset. These networks are constantly evolving, but a balance needs to be maintained between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Uses:__ Frequently used for generating realistic images.\n",

    "### Support Vector Machine (SVM)\n",
    "![SVM](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SVM_1.png)\n",
    "These are __not always considered neural networks__ but we'll give a brief description of these since they're a frequently used buzzword and are used frequently in conjuction with neural networks, if not on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Characteristics:__ Only used for binary classification, or simply, when you only want certain possilibilities: \"yes\" or \"no,\" 0 or 1, etc. No matter how many layers or dimensions (or inputs) you give your neural network, it will only give you a binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>__Uses:__ Any type of classification problem. __Some people__ consider this a good first choice for any classification problem, since it's often one of the most flexible and effective choices (although this is a debated claim).\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these are obviously simplifications of what actually goes on behind the scenes of these neural networks, and there are also hundreds more not discussed in this workshop.

    "\n",
    "#### Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This learning occurs without human help. With supervised learning, we label or classify the datasets beforehand and tell the algorithm what results it should get. With unsupervised learning, the data given is neither labeled or classified. The algorithm tries to learn from it without guidance. \n",
    "<br>Use Case: Compressing and Decompressing images, Recommending products to a consumer based on their purchase and browsing history.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be a mix of supervised and unsupervised learning. The algorithm processes data, and then learns and changes based on feedback you give it on it's results.\n",
