    "The Boston housing price dataset is one of several datasets included with `sklearn`. It contains 506 samples of houses in the Boston area, with measurements of 13 attributes of each (e.g. per capita crime, tax rate, pupil-teacher ratio, etc.), with the 'target' (y) variable being the price of the house. The goal is to train a model to find a regression from the x-data to the y-data.\n",

    "`sklearn` comes with a variety of models that excel at different tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is one large distinction between models to make: There are *classifiers*, and *regressions*. __Classifiers pick from a list of label options to predict what something is (e.g. apples, oranges), while regressions guess a value on a continuous spectrum (e.g. a number on the Richter scale, *the price of a house*)__\n",
    "\n",
    " - __Classifiers *label* things, e.g.:__\n",
    "    - This is picture of a cat\n",
    "    - This data seems to represent an orange\n",
    "    - This sounds like this person's voice\n",
    " - __Regressions *estimate* things, e.g.:__\n",
    "    - This was probably a 3.5 on the Richter scale\n",
    "    - This stock will grow 5% by tomorrow\n",
    "    - This house probably cost $100k\n",
    "\n",
    "For this dataset, it is most valid to use a *regression* to predict the prices of the houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "`sklearn`'s `linear_model` family comes with numerous regressions to apply, like `LinearRegression`, `Lasso`, `Ridge`, and many more, which can be found at the [official documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Training and Using a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, many of `sklearn`'s models work the same, and can be used by replacing `some_model_variety` below with the model family you'd like to load, and `ModelOfChoice` with the specific model you'd like to use.\n",

    "Due to the math behind Tensorflow, the ranges and average values of different x-variables (e.g. crime rate vs. average rooms per house) have an impact on what the model considers important. For example, crime rates are formatted as percentages between 0 and 1, while the property tax is a number that usually lies in the 200s. Because of this difference, a neural network may consider property tax to be more hundreds of times more important than the crime rate.\n",
