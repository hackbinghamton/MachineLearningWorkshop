# MachineLearningWorkshop

## Getting Started

In this workshop, we'll be going over everything machine learning. Machine learning is the study of writing programs that get better at solving problems with experience. We'll be using `scikit-learn` and Tensorflow to apply machine learning to problems like recognizing hand-written symbols, estimating housing prices, predicting stock prices, and identifying fake news.
